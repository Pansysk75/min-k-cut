C++ Implementation of Gomory-Hu Tree construction, and computation of Minimum k-cut.
Assignment for 2025 "Algorithm Design & Analysis" course (LSU CSC 7300)

The Gomoryâ€“Hu tree of a weighted undirected graph is a weighted tree that represents the minimum s-t cuts for all s-t pairs in the graph. 
The Gomory-Hu Tree can also be used to find an approximate solution for the minimum k-cut of a graph.
